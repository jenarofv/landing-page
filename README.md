# The Odin Project Landing Page

Landing page I made using flexbox, guided by [this project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

Here are some important details:

- I read about using css variables in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

- Roboto font is imported from [Google Fonts](fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
